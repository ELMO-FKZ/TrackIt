The application automatically assigns the To Do status to newly added projects. The status can be changed to In Progress by either completing a task or manually updating the status. Projects can be blocked only when they are in the In Progress status. Additionally, a project in the In Progress status can be changed back to To Do by unchecking all tasks or manually updating the status. Completion of all tasks marks the project as Completed.

For every project, there is a progress bar that visually represents the number of days left until the project's deadline. It also indicates the number of tasks completed out of the total tasks. This feature helps users monitor the progress of their projects and stay on track with deadlines.
